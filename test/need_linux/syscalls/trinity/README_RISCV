Using trinity on RISCV is simple.

Define the CROSS_COMPILE environment variable on your system
to be the prefix for the RISCV toolchain to use
(e.g. riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu- if $RISCV/bin is on your $PATH)
with the final dash.

Then, run ./configure in the same directory as the source,
and run make. The trinity binary that will be created is
ready for use in riscv.

See other READMEs and the usage message for help in actually
using trinity.
