Spike tester:
A tester for simple, single-file C programs that
must be run inside a spike variant.
Designed to be used with C programs that return nonzero
or are sent signals to be killed when they fail.
Works by telling the particular spike variant to run
a (provided in run_tests.c) C testing progrm that runs
compiled C binaries on startup, and waiting for termination.

To use, copy testrunner_setup_disk.sh to the linux directory.
Then, modify "NUM_TESTS" and optionally NUM_PROCS and TIMEOUT
at the top of compile_tests.py to reflect your build system.
If you want to compile your tests with optimizations, modify
the "CC" prompt as well.

Then, run ./run_testsuite.sh <test folder path> <path to linux folder>
<name of spike variant on PATH>.
