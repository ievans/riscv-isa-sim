SPEC tester:
A tester for SPEC2006 programs that must be run inside a spike variant.
Requires SPEC2006 programs to be compiled and resident
in their run directories, along with a runner script.

The proper folder scheme looks like:
run/
  400/
    run_base_test_gcc43-64bit.0000/
      executable
      ...
      run_test.sh
  401/
    run_base_test_gcc43-64bit.0000/
      ...
  ...

The runner script (run_test.sh) is the output of
'specinvoke -n' run in each run directory.
To obtain the run_test.sh for 400 (for example),
after having sourced the SPEC shrc, run

specinvoke -n > run_test.sh
chmod +x run_test.sh

and then add the following two lines to the top of run_test.sh:

#!/bin/bash
cd $(dirname $0)

This tester works by telling the particular spike variant to run
a (provided in run_spec_tests.c) C testing program that runs
compiled C binaries on startup, and quits spike when it is done.
The TIMEOUT for these tests is at the top of run_spec_tests.py.

To use, copy testrunner_setup_disk.sh (and inittab_nosh)
to the linux directory.
Then, run ./run_testsuite.sh <test folder path> <path to linux folder>
<name of spike variant on PATH>.
