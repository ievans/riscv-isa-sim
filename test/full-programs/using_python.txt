After downloading and untar-ing python,
it can be used in riscv-linux by creating a disk image
holding the entire folder (use disk image size of at least 4M).
Then, after riscv-linux boots the files in sysroot-destdir
must be moved to their appropriate locations
(e.g. python/sysroot-destdir/include -> /usr/include).

Python was compiled with riscv-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc from
the tags branch on Mar 29 2015.
