C++ exceptions work using this libgcc_s.so.1

The way this works is that RA is blessed on exception handling
return (specifically, the _Unwind_RaiseException function's
return if a handler is found in libgcc).

Unfortunately, changing libgcc to do this is difficult,
as it installs the exception handling context in a way that
there is no place to insert a settag instruction via
inline assembly.

Therefore, this libgcc's settag instruction overwrites an
existing instruction to restore the 11th floating point
register. Thus, programs that use the 11th floating point
register and exception handling may have issues.

(Maybe there is a way to compile programs with gcc
to not use that register?)
